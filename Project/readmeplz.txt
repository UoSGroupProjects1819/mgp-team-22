Hey guys,

this folder should be the route folder for the unity project, rather than having a folder within the folder.

we don't need multiple folders for different iterations of the game as we can use
github to rollback if needed / make branches if there will be experimental builds.

if you need any help with these git features give me a shout on discord or email me
and I'll show you.
